# ComfortType
An aesthetic minimalistic, clean typing test.

## Theme
In the future I plan on adding a themes menu on hover at the right of the screen, as well as a hotkey to cycle through themes.
For now this inplementation is on the backburner until it is the last thing I need to work on ;)

## Redo
To redo the test (on a random new quote) press [ <kbd>Enter</kbd> ] or the redo button

## Calculations
The javascript calculation for the WPM: 'Math.round(((charIndex - mistakes) / 5) / (maxTime - timeLeft) * 60)'
